  abstract = {Scholars have for several decades now assumed that most if not virtually all of the Indic texts transmitted to China in the first few centuries of the Common Era were written in a Northwest Middle Indic language widely known as Gāndhārī. Much of the data for this hypothesis has derived from the reconstructed pronunciation of Chinese transcriptions of Indian proper names and Buddhist technical terms contained in the early Chinese Buddhist translations. This paper, inspired by the recent brilliant work of Seishi Karashima, attempts to reexamine this assumption from another angle. A closer look at problems in the translation process itself reveals that the collaboration of the Chinese members of the early translation teams may have been instrumental in formulating the final shape these renderings assumed. Such a realization will require us to reassess our use of these documents for the history of Indian Buddhist languages and texts.}

Focusing on rounding, palatalization, and velarization, we challenge that view by showing that palatalization, velariazation, and labialization are properties of onsets, nuclei and codas, not properties of segments. If we are correct, the traditional notion “segment” has a limited and superficial status in the study of human language.},

  abstract = {Taiwan’s aboriginal peoples are thought to be related to ancestral Austronesian-speaking peoples. Currently, Taiwan has 14 officially acknowledged aboriginal tribes. The major crops currently farmed in aboriginal areas are rice (Oryza sativa) and foxtail millet (Setaria italica). Archeologists recently excavated the remains of several early cultures in Taiwan. The most plentiful plant remains were carbonated rice and foxtail millet grains. The earliest 14C date of these excavation sites is ∼5,000 BP. These settlements may be those of the earliest ancestral Austronesian speakers in Taiwan. Rice domestication is a complex story. In this study, we identified the functional nucleotide polymorphisms of 16 domesticationrelated genes using 60 landraces collected from aboriginal Taiwanese villages about 100 years ago. We also screened the phenotypes of these landraces. By integrating phenoand genotypic data, together with data from archeologists and linguists, we may be able to better understand the history of rice cultivation in Taiwan and nearby areas.},

Theoretical discussions include questions of phonological representation (featural contours, prosodic licensing etc.) and the phonology-phonetics interface.},

We show here that natural languages are much more economical in their use of laryngeal contrasts than segmental models would lead us to expect. Specifically, we show that voicing, aspiration and glottalisation occur at most once per onset, nucleus or coda in a given language, and that the order in which they are produced within onset, nucleus and coda is never contrastive. To account for these restrictions, we propose that laryngeal features are properties not of segments, but of the onsets, nuclei and codas that dominate them.},

  abstract = {The current waves of migration sweeping the Chinese world may seem like new phenomena, the outcome of modernization and industrialization. However, this concise and readable book convincingly shows that contemporary movements are just the most recent stage in a long history of migration, both within China and beyond its borders. Distinguished historian Diana Lary traces the continuous expansion and contraction of the Chinese state over more than four millennia. Periods of expansion, which involved huge movements of people, have been interspersed with periods of inward-turning stasis. Following a chronological framework, the author discusses the migrations themselves and the recurrent themes within them. We see migration as a broad spectrum of movement, from short-term and short-range to permanent and long-range, and as a powerful vehicle for the transfer of commodities, culture, religion, and political influence. The Confucian tradition treated migration as undesirable. It praised the delights of staying at home: “A thousand days at home are good, half a day away is hard.” Lary argues that, despite this view, migration has been a key element in the evolution of Chinese society, one that the state disparages and encourages at the same time. Her book will be compelling for all readers who want to understand the context for the present internal and international migrations that have changed the face of China itself and its international relations.},

A velarized feature is reconstructed for several correspondences that show diphthongs in the Northern Tai (NT) branch but simple vowels in the Southern Tai (ST) branch, as well as for the difference between the NT higher vowel reflexes and ST lower vowel reflexes. A labialized feature occurs in some rimes and causes certain unrounded vowels to become rounded. Eleven endings are reconstructed, including PT *-l and *-c, which are not recognized in Li’s system.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {This discussion attempts to reconcile various seemingly contradictory research results regarding the origins of Jōmon Japanese. The focus is on testing Oppenheimer's theory of Holocene outmigration from the former continent of Sundaland in present-day Southeast Asia against the evidence relating to Jōmon Japan and the "Out of Taiwan" hypothesis for Austronesian language dispersal. It is argued here that postglacial flooding of Sundaland prompted some former inhabitants to migrate from around ten or eleven thousand years ago, and that they followed the expanding belt of lucidophyllous forest, eventually to settle in what is now Japan during the Jōmon Period, in accordance with the theory of regional pockets of "laurilignosa culture." It is stressed that some of these people were probably speakers of Austronesian languages.

  abstract = {This discussion attempts to reconcile various seemingly contradictory research results regarding the origins of Jōmon Japanese. The focus is on testing Oppenheimer's theory of Holocene outmigration from the former continent of Sundaland in present-day Southeast Asia against the evidence relating to Jōmon Japan and the "Out of Taiwan" hypothesis for Austronesian language dispersal. It is argued here that postglacial flooding of Sundaland prompted some former inhabitants to migrate from around ten or eleven thousand years ago, and that they followed the expanding belt of lucidophyllous forest, eventually to settle in what is now Japan during the Jōmon Period, in accordance with the theory of regional pockets of "laurilignosa culture." It is stressed that some of these people were probably speakers of Austronesian languages. Further, it is argued that the "Out of Taiwan" movement of Austronesian language speakers could have occurred later as a migratory counterflow accompanying the Holocene maximum, and that an "Out of Sunda" scenario of migration to Japan in the Jōmon period is not necessarily entirely incompatible with such an "Out of Taiwan" theory. 縄文時代の日本人の起源については諸説あるが、中には相反するように見えるものもある。この論文ではスチーべン・オツぺンハイマー氏のいわゆる「スンダランド起源」論が縄文日本の状況にも当てはまるかどうかが考察される。氏の理論によると、氷河期後、現在の東南アジアにあった「スンダランド」という大陸が大部分水没したため、その大陸に居住していた人々は周囲の島や大陸等に移住しようとした。この論文では一部が今の日本列島に辿り着き、「縄文人」となったと仮定する。そういう人々は佐々木高明氏の論じる照葉樹林帯の拡大を追って北方ヘ移動し、照葉樹林文化帯を形成した。オーストロネシア言語 (いわゆ南方語) を話した可能性もある。この説は、定説の「台湾起源論」がとるオーストロネシア文化起源論とは相容れないと思われがちだが、 (北方移動説の) 「スンダ起源論」と (逆の南方移動説の) 「台湾起源説」では人口移動に関して時間のずれがあるため、両説は必ずしも相反するものではないと思われる。},

  abstract = {This book traces the history of noh and kyōgen, the first major Japanese theatrical arts. Going beyond P. G. O'Neill's Early Nō Drama of 1958, it covers the full period of noh's medieval development and includes a chapter dedicated to the comic art of kyōgen, which has often been left in noh's shadow. It is based on contemporary research in Japan, Asia, Europe and America, and embraces current ideas of theatre history, providing a richly contextualized account which looks closely at theatrical forms and genres as they arose. The masked drama of noh, with its ghosts, chanting and music, and its use in Japanese films, has been the object of modern international interest. However, audiences are often confused as to what noh actually is. This book attempts to answer where noh came from, what it was like in its day, and what it was for. To that end, it contains sections which discuss a number of prominent noh plays in their period and challenges established approaches. It also contains the first detailed study in English of the kyōgen repertoire of the sixteenth-century.},

  abstract = {In recent years, there have appeared new interpretations of the Ancient Chinese from the phonemic point of view, e.g. \emph{The Phonemes of Ancient Chinese} (Supplement to the JAOS No.16 1953) by Samuel E. MARTIN, \&ldquo;Setsuin no imbo o kaishaku -suru\&rdquo;(in the \emph{Okayama Daigaku Hobungakubu Kiyo} 3, 1954) by Fumio KUSAKABE, and \&ldquo;Chtigokugo no Shiteki-on'inron\&rdquo;(in the \emph{Nihon Cita gokugakkai Kaiho} 6, 1954) by Akiyasu TODO One of the most controversial problems is how to solve the isolated final in the rhyme The author assumes this final as *aun just as FORREST reconstructed in his \emph{The Chinese Language} (London 1948), and pushing this assumption to the whole system of finals, he attempts a tentative solution of the system of finals in the Ancient Chinese (represented by the \emph{Ts'ie-Y\&uuml;n}) as shown on p.16. The apparent self-consistency of the system, however, does not necessarily mean that the \emph{Ts'ie-Y\&uuml;n} was compiled basing on one dialect as assumed by B. KARLGREN and CHOU Fakao. The author follows the opinion that the \emph{Ts'ie-Y\&uuml;}n had the characteristics of the Northern standard language reflecting partially the system of prcedent times and also of another dialects. The different usage of fan-ts'ie in Hsiian-Ying's \emph{Yi-ts'ie} Ching Yin-yi shows that the system of the \emph{Ts'se-Yuuml;}n had been followed as a norm at that period.},

The interpretation of the finals is shown as Table III, and in connection with this, he indicates that besides the neutral initials 半舌音 and 舌上音 the initials 之昌時式而 (正歯音 and 半歯音) also became neutral as for the opposition of the fan-ch'ieh doublets (重紐).},

  abstract = {The languages of Northeast Asia show evidence of dispersal from south to north, consistent with the hypothesis that agriculture spread north and east from the vicinity of Liaoning, beginning with the millets approximately 5500 BP. Wet rice agriculture in Korea and Japan results from a later spread, also beginning in Shandong, crossing via the Liaodong peninsula and reaching the Korean peninsula around 1500 BCE. This dispersal is associated with the Mumun archaeological culture after 1500 BCE in the Korean peninsula and the Yayoi culture after 950 BCE in the Japanese archipelago. From a linguistic standpoint, it is associated with the entry of the Japonic language family, first into the Korean peninsula, subsequently into the Japanese archipelago. The arrival of Koreanic is associated with the advent of the Korean-style bronze dagger culture and a temporary hiatus in wet rice agriculture sites around 300 BCE. Both Koreanic and Japonic are relatively shallow language families, with Koreanic the shallower of the two, consistent with the chronology above. The gap between the earliest linguistically motivated dates for these language families and the archaeological events is the result of a linguistic founders effect, providing further evidence for demic diffusion as a source for their distribution.},

Measures of pronunciation distance are used in several subfields of linguistics, including psycholinguistics, dialectology and typology. In contrast to the commonly used Levenshtein algorithm, NDL is grounded in cognitive theory of competitive reinforcement learning and is able to generate asymmetrical pronunciation distances. In a first study, we validated the NDL-based pronunciation distances by comparing them to a large set of native-likeness ratings given by native American English speakers when presented with accented English speech. In a second study, the NDL-based pronunciation distances were validated on the basis of perceptual dialect distances of Norwegian speakers. Results indicated that the NDL-based pronunciation distances matched perceptual distances reasonably well with correlations ranging between 0.7 and 0.8. While the correlations were comparable to those obtained using the Levenshtein distance, the NDL-based approach is more flexible as it is also able to incorporate acoustic information other than sound segments.},

Ten years after Ted Pedersen’s influential “Last Words” contribution in Computational Linguistics, we investigate to what extent researchers in computational linguistics are willing and able to share their data and code. We surveyed all 395 full papers presented at the 2011 and 2016 ACL Annual Meetings, and identified whether links to data and code were provided. If working links were not provided, authors were requested to provide this information. Although data were often available, code was shared less often. When working links to code or data were not provided in the paper, authors provided the code in about one third of cases. For a selection of ten papers, we attempted to reproduce the results using the provided data and code. We were able to reproduce the results approximately for six papers. For only a single paper did we obtain the exact same results. Our findings show that even though the situation appears to have improved comparing 2016 to 2011, empiricism in computational linguistics still largely remains a matter of faith. Nevertheless, we are somewhat optimistic about the future. Ensuring reproducibility is not only important for the field as a whole, but also seems worthwhile for individual researchers: The median citation count for studies with working links to the source code is higher.},

  abstract = {This work combines two complementary studies that are based on different materials: (1) application of the comparative method to a dialect glossary of Bai, and (2) analysis of spoken text materials collected by the author during two years of research and study in the People's Republic of China.    While the nature and genetic status of Bai remain controversial until now, with some scholars exploiting unusual Bai/Chinese correspondences to reconstruct an ancestral stage of Sinitic, what the comparative study of Bai dialects shows is that internal correspondence patterns that are clearly regular and inherent to the dialects involve lexical morphemes of different proveniences, Chinese as well as Tibeto-Burman. That being the case, it is not clear whether such patterns are more appropriately viewed in the context of historical developments well established for parts of Chinese, or alternatively, linked with developments now generally acknowledged as diagnostic for the Loloish grouping of Tibeto-Burman.    This type of mixed resemblance is not inconsistent with the picture we get from looking at the Bai grammar, as is demonstrated by the preliminary analysis in Chapter 3 of text materials recorded from a native speaker. The grammar that emerges from study of these spoken materials suggests a significant literary influence from Chinese. A pronoun system that is inflected for case in genitive functions shows extended applications to nominalization (in combination and competition with a true nominalizing particle), and a system of verbal functors operating in ordered serial constructions allows comparison to well-established analyses of similar paradigms in Chinese and Tibeto-Burman languages. The consultant's language is considered in the light of published descriptions available for the Bai dialects, and found to consistently represent the standard dialect of Jianchuan despite systematic departures, some of which may be treated as supporting evidence for reconstruction of retroflex consonants, rare in the modern dialects. Unusual phonation-type features of the consultant's speech are described and drawn into the comparative study, where they figure in tonogenetic speculations leading to a proposal for convergence of different historical sound changes from two source languages at an earlier stage.    Considered study of the linguistic data raises questions about the historical background of the Bai speech community, and the present work adds some new information in this domain in an introduction based mainly on scholarly materials obtained recently in China.},

  abstract = {It has been claimed that the Yue dialects best preserve the stop endings of Middle Chinese *-p, *-t and *-k. The bulk of dialect materials available at present contain not only Yue dialects that faithfully or almost faithfully preserve these endings, but also those that have displayed change to various degrees. This array of variety enables us to better understand the nature and conditions for change with respect to these endings and to figure out some general tendency in the principles guiding the change. In tracing the development of the stop endings of various dialects from proto-Yue, several general principles of change have been observed: (1) assimilation is the key word for the condition of the change in the great majority of cases. The change from *-p or *-k to -t is largely due to assimilation of the ending to a higher vowel while the change from *-t or from *-p to -k is due to assimilation of the ending to a lower vowel; (2) syllables derived from proto-Yue with tense vowels are more prone to change; (3) the complete loss of ending consonants are closely related to two factors, tenseness of the vowel and higher tonal value; (4) the rate of change differs from dialect to dialect and within the same dialect, from lexical item to lexical item.},

  abstract = {The Peiligang Culture (9000-7000 cal. yr BP) in the Middle Yellow River region, North China, has long been considered representative of millet farming. It is still unclear, however, if broomcorn millet or foxtail millet was the first species domesticated during the Peiligang Culture. Furthermore, it is also unknown whether millet was cultivated singly or together with rice at the same period. In this study, phytolith analysis of samples from the Tanghu archaeological site reveals early crop information in the Middle Yellow River region, China. Our results show that broomcorn millet was the early dry farming species in the Peiligang Culture at 7800 cal. yr BP, while rice cultivation took place from 7800 to 4500 cal. yr BP. Our data provide new evidence of broomcorn millet and rice mixed farming at 7800 cal. yr BP in the Middle Yellow River region, which has implications for understanding the domestication process of the two crops, and the formation and continuance of the Ancient Yellow River Civilization.},

  abstract = {The first half of the Zhou Dynasty, known as Western Zhou, was a critical formative period of Chinese civilization.  Western Zhou introduced philosophical ideas, cultural motifs, governing practices, and social institutions that have had a profound and lasting impact on Chinese and East Asian societies.  Unfortunately, only a partial chronology of this time period survives.  Recovering the absolute dates of Western Zhou has since become a classical question that remained unresolved for over two millennia.  Here I report a successful reconstruction of this long-sought chronology using archaeoastronomical methods.  Systematic analysis of the relative compatibility of all 81 known fully-dated bronze inscriptions revealed the definitions of the lunar phase terms, which enabled computation of absolute dates.  These calculations, combined with available archaeological and textual evidence, produced a complete chronology starting in the year King Wen received the Mandate of Heaven and ending in the year of King Ping's death.  The results also reveal a previously unknown seven-year gap in the regnal years of Zhou, which explains the inconsistencies between excavated material and the annals of Shiji.  The complete chronology reported here is highly consistent with archaeological evidence, textual records, and astronomical events, thus providing a reliable temporal framework for studying ancient Chinese history, and facilitating a deeper understanding of the origins of Chinese civilization.},
